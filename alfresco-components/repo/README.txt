Jive Toolkit - Alfresco Repository Components
=============================================

Author: Peter Monks


Installation
------------

The extensions have been developed to install on top of an existing Alfresco
3.4.1 installation, via an AMP file.

Note that this version of the tool requires *exactly* Alfresco Enterprise
version 3.4.1, due to the use of an overridden web.xml file.  The web.xml
file is different between 3.4.0, 3.4.1 and (yet to be released) 3.4.2.
